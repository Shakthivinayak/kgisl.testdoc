    <h4>My Qualification</h4>
    <p><pre>At the beginning of this trip in the summer institute, I was not sure whether I could accommodate here. But my academic journey here really gave a good enjoyment of study life.

        My first lesson was about leadership. 
        The teacher Dr. Tim was so kind and helpful that he was always 
        ready to teach and help us. Rather than a teacher, I would say 
        he was our very good friend. Besides the good preparation of the
         teaching materials, he would continuously encourage us to think more 
         and express our ideas. We had a lot of discussions in class, where we 
         would communicate our thoughts to our team members together. I became 
         more confident during this process that no one would laugh at you even they
          had different opinions from you. From this class, I not only mastered the 
          relevant knowledge, but only learned how to express my ideas and share with others more.</pre></p>
